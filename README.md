        Which language has been used for this web application?
    </dt>
    <dd>
        I used vue.js in the frontend and PHP for the backend. I used the PHP Laravel Framework(v8.0) aswell to interact with the frontend.

        How can I install the police cad on my webserver?
    </dt>

        Please make sure that your webserver meets the requirements. Without that it will not work! <br />
        First of all upload the files up to your webserver. After that open https://plesk.com or create a new subdomain. You need to set the root folder in order to make the system navigate to the right folder and work well. <br />
        Lets say the path is the folowing:<br />
        <code>mywebsite.com/mysubdomain.mywebsite.com</code><br />
        Now add <code>/public</code> to the end of your path so it should looks like that: <code>mywebsite.com/mysubdomain.mywebsite.com/public</code> <br />
        Save your settings and open your subdomain in your browser.
        <br />
        <br />
        Now you need to setup your database credentials. I've provided a small setup to do that. Everything should be understandable. Please fill out the form correctly and safe your settings. <br />
        After you setup your database connection's you should now be able to open your subdomain in your browser. It should now show a login form. Keep in Mind - there is no registration form due to security purposes. Nobody except your officers should have login credentials to login into the cad.
        <br /><br />
        The default login credentials are:<br />
        <code>
        Username: <b>developer</b><br />
        Password: <b>developer2021</b><br />
            </code>
        <br />
        Please change the password as soon as you logged in into the cad. Use a strong and safe password to protect your developer account! Dont use the password you use anywhere else!<br /><br />
        That's it! You can now create new officer accounts and use all of the functions, I've mentioned above!

        Do you provide any other systems?

    <dd>
        Yes. I provide a Medical system and mechanic system aswell. They're in the same design and have other functions, which you need for the type of their systems.
